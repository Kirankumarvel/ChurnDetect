# ChurnDetect - AI-powered Churn Detection 🔍

## Overview
ChurnDetect is a machine learning-based system designed to predict customer churn. By analyzing customer behavior and historical data, it helps businesses take proactive measures to retain customers. 

## Features
- 🔍 **Churn Prediction:** Identifies customers at risk of churning.
- 📊 **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and transforms raw data for model training.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models:** Uses advanced algorithms for accurate predictions.
- 📈 **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates model effectiveness using precision, recall, and F1-score.
- 🚀 **Deployment-Ready:** Can be integrated into business workflows via API.
